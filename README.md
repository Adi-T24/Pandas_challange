We looked at data of the city school district in order to better understand the relationships in expenditure and the academic success of the area.  After a through analysis of the data we have arrived at the following conclusions:

The over all budget of the district is 24 million dollars. 
Overall passing rate is 65%.
Schools with higher budget were able to get higher results across reading and writing categories as well as the over all passing.  There is a strong linear relationship between budget and kids passing with at least 70%. 
Charter School tend to perform better over all across all categories and over all. 
size of the school vs results reflects the smaller the better as smaller class size has shown a larger lean toward the higher marks.
